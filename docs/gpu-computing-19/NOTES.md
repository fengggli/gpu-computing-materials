## Presentations

#### presentation 1: intro to neural networks, deep learning, and backpropagation [2019-01-23]
* We had our first discussion on Jan 18, 2019, the outline of our first presentation is [here](/docs/gpu-computing-19/presentation_1_outline.md)
* The slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mgcXAEhjIjccVH5eulKZUPSqueVNh7CkPg7BI5vt2kY/edit?usp=sharing)

#### presentation: 2 a deeper look at CNN's, ResNET, and implementation details:
* The second outline is [here](/docs/gpu-computing-19/presentation_2_outline.md)

## Project

[Jan 26]: 
* We had a disussion on how we can start the project, the notes are [here](/docs/gpu-computing-19/project_discuss_1.md)

[inital]:
* I will update my initial resnet implementation very soon. It will use numpy.

A implementation of a ANN framework for deep neural networks in CUDA
NOTE : this is using thrust with some custom wrapper classes.
