Presentation 2
Introduce detailed convolution NN 
What are they used for?
Performance
How convolutions save space
Layers
Common structures
Pooling, padding, bias, other concepts
ResNet
Vanishing gradients : Motivation for resnet (gradients get less effective as network depth increases)
Identify layers should be able to be introduced with no negative consequences, but this is not true in a normal 
Structure
Blocks 
Shortcut or feedforward
Challenges we might face
Gpu and other engineering considerations
