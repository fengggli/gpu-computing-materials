# Discussion on presentations

## Presentation 1 (intro)

Sections are: 

1. Introduction and relationship to neuron (10 to 12 min)
    * Asdl;kfj
    * What is diff between “deep learning” and “machine learning?”	

2. Show detailed forward backward pass / gradient descent (15 - 20 min)
    * Forward pass
    * Back pass

3. Quick Into to CNN (for next presentation)
    * What is diff between NN and CNN. Why are we telling you this
    * Convolution NN are like NN where the weights are replaced by filters
    * Introduce what we will do next time (What is resNet?)


## Presentation 2

Sections are:

1. Introduce detailed convolution NN 
    * What are they used for?
    * Layers
    * Common structures
    * Pooling, padding, bias, other concepts

2. ResNet
    * Identiy layers should be able to be introduced with no negative consequences, but this is not true in a nornal 
    * Structure
        * Blocks 
        * Shortcut or feedforward
        * Other shit
3. Challenges we might face
4. GPU and other engineering considerations
